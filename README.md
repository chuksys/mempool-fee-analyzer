# Mempool Fee Analyzer

This is an open-source project that aims to make it easier to check the reliability of multiple mempool-based fee estimation strategies.

We aim to start by building a command-line tool and then gradually add a GUI to it.

We believe that mempool-based fee estimation can go a long way in improving the fees paid for bitcoin transactions included in blocks. 

This project aims to iteratively test multiple mempool-based fee estimation strategies with the aim of getting the community to see how reliable they are.

We'd love to work with others who are also passionate about this subject-matter. To Contribute, please read the Contribution.md guide.

Thank you.
